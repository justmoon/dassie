 * ### Ledger Account Structure
 *
 * ```plain
 * assets/…
 *   settlement          Assets held on the underlying ledger
 *   interledger/[peer]  Amount owed to us by the peer
 * liabilities/…
 * contra/…
 *   trust/[peer]        Represents trust extended to a peer and reduces the
 *                       interledger asset account (possibly turning it negative
 *                       and into a liability)
 * equity/…
 *   owner               Owner's equity account
 *   suspense            Suspense account (used to keep the assets/settlement
 *                       account matching the underlying ledger)
 * revenue/…
 *   fees                Fees earned by the node in the course of its operation
 *   fx                  Foreign exchange account
 * expenses/…
 *   fees                Fees paid by the node (such as node registration)
 *   fx                  Foreign exchange account
 * ```
