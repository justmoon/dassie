<Aside type="tip">
Dassie is not a blockchain - payments are routed like packets through the network and are not stored. The only shared state is the link state used for routing.
</Aside>

## Next steps

<CardGrid stagger>
	<Card title="Scalable" icon="rocket">
		Dassie can handle very large amounts of very small payments and scales horizontally meaning its throughput capacity increases as more nodes join the network.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Currency-neutral" icon="seti:shell">
		Dassie automatically handles currency exchange and routing. You can use any (supported) currency you like and still transact with everyone else on the Dassie network.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Ledger-neutral" icon="document">
		The current implementation uses various cryptocurrencies as the underlying value transfer systems, but Dassie is based on [Interledger](https://interledger.org/), which means that it can be used with any payments system with an open API.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Under development" icon="setting">
		Dassie is still in the early stages of development and is not yet ready for production use. If you're still interested, [give it a try](/guides/quick-start/).
