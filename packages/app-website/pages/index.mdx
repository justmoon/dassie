# Dassie
 
A peer-to-peer network which can transfer tiny amounts of money quickly and cheaply.

It's not a blockchain - payments are routed like packets through the network and are not stored.

## Why Dassie?

### Scalable

Dassie can handle very large amounts of very small payments and scales horizontally meaning its capacity increases as more nodes join the network.

### Currency-neutral

Dassie automatically handles currency exchange and routing. You can use any (supported) currency you like and still transact with everyone else on the Dassie network.

### Ledger-neutral

The current implementation uses various cryptocurrencies as the underlying value transfer systems, but Dassie is based on [Interledger](https://interledger.org/), which means that it can be used with any payments system with an open API.

## Status

The Dassie project is the very early stages of development. The first version of the software is expected to be released in the next few months.
