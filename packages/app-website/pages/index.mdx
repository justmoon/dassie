# What is Dassie?
 
A peer-to-peer network which can transfer tiny amounts of money quickly and cheaply.

It's not a blockchain - payments are routed like packets through the network and are not stored. The only shared state is the link state used for routing.

## Why Dassie?

### Scalable

Dassie can handle very large amounts of very small payments and scales horizontally meaning its throughput capacity increases as more nodes join the network.

### Currency-neutral

Dassie automatically handles currency exchange and routing. You can use any (supported) currency you like and still transact with everyone else on the Dassie network.

### Ledger-neutral

The current implementation uses various cryptocurrencies as the underlying value transfer systems, but Dassie is based on [Interledger](https://interledger.org/), which means that it can be used with any payments system with an open API.

## Status

The Dassie project is in the very early stages of development. The current version is a preview release which only supports test payments (without real-world value) and does not yet support currency conversion.
